The function and requirement is to input a year and month, and the system outputs the calendar for that month. Due to the lack of existing functions in the system, new variables and functions are defined to address this. The primary challenge is handling months with different lengths - 31 days for longer months, typically 30 days for shorter ones, and a unique case for February. February's days depend on whether the year is a leap year, with 29 days in a leap year and 28 otherwise. Necessary functions include determining the weekday for a given date, checking if a year is a leap year, calculating the number of days in a month, finding the first day of a month, and printing the calendar. Function names are designed to be self-explanatory for ease of checking and reading the program. This design simplifies error checking and clarifies the development process and logic. The system is secure, with complete data post-January 1, 2001, and is developed in C++ using the 'std' namespace.
